# mr_miyagi

This is a repo for a conversation with mr miyagi

## Specification of the game
every statement/question must start with Sensei, otherwise:
- input = not include 'Sensei' at the beginning of the sentence
- output = 'You are smart, but not wise - address me as Sensei please'

every time you ask a question --> Mr. Miyagi responde with
- input = includes a question mark at the end of the sentence
- output = 'questions are wise, but for now. Wax on, and Wax off!'

every time you mention 'block' or 'blocking' --> Mr. Miyagi responde with
- input = includes the word block somewhere in the sentence
- output = 'Remember, best block, not to be there..'

anything else you say:
- input = anything that doesn't satisfy the other conditions
- output = 'do not lose focus. Wax on. Wax off.'

Make it so you keep playing until we say: 'Sensei, I am at peace'
- input = 'Sensei, I am at peace'
- output = 'Sometimes, what heart know, head forget'
